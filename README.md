This is a translator project that helped me practice my **React** skills, let me experience **Web Speech API** and made me get to know **SASS** even more.  I tried creating a clean and usable file structure. To keep my code clean and readable, I used **Prettier** and **ESLint**.  I used **Axios** to handle api requests and **React Table** to display data.
